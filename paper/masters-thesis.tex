\begin{abstract}
This report presents PLSI, a portable VLSI flow designed to enable RTL-based
computer architecture research.  The interesting part of PLSI are the tools
that implement the various rules and the interchange formats that are passed
between the various tools.  The fundamental driving design decision behind PLSI
is that computers are better than performing repetitive, arithmetic-laden tasks
that humans are.  When implementing PLSI I took my experience from working with
a handful of tapeout teams.  This report present implementations of Rocket,
Hwacha, and BOOM on the Synopses 32nm Educational Technology.

\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like thank my fellow graduate students: Colin Schmidt and Ben Keller
for helping work on our chips, Andrew Waterman and Yunsup Lee for giving me lot
of advice during my studies, Chris Celio for providing BOOM, as well as the
Berkeley Architecture Research Group.  Without them, as well as the numerous
other contributors to both Rocket Chip and the general RISC-V ecosystem, I
would never have had all the infrastructure I needed to even start this thesis.

I would also like to thank my advisors Krste Asanovic and Jonathan Barchrach
for providing advice throughout my graduate studies, as well as John
Kubiatowicz who was my advisor for my first two years at Berkeley.  I would
also like to thank Dave Patterson, who helped while finishing my thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank Lulu Li and my parents for always being around
when I need them.
