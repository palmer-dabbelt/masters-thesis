\chapter{Results}

PLSI has been implemented and works for multiple Rocket Chip based designs.
This section presents the results for Rocket, BOOM, and Hwacha on Synopsys'
32nm Educational PDK produced via the Synopsys tools.  In addition to
presenting the results, there is a discussion of the validity of the results.

These results were all run using the latest version of Rocket Chip that
supported the various configurations when this thesis was being written.  The
excat versions of Rocket Chip differ between the various targets because all
the forks aren't up to date at all times, but they're all tagged as git
submodules in the thesis repository.  Newer versions of Rocket Chip have
removed support for the L2 cache, which is why the Hwacha configuration (which
is based on an older version of Rocket Chip) is the only configuration that has
an L2 cache attached.

\section{Discussion}

The results in this section and meant to be suitable for doing computer
architecture research, not for building an actual chip.  As such they skip the
signoff sections of the flow that, from my experience when building chips,
don't have meaningful effects on QoR but take a lot of time to get right.

The simplest configuration run for this thesis was the default Rocket
configuration, DefaultConfig.  This contains Rocket, 64-bit a 5 stage in-order
core, with 32 KiB split L1 caches and a floating-point unit.  This
configuration and floorplan gets very good performance (1.5GHz) on commercial
28nm technologies, but it appears that the 32nm Synopsys EDK is significantly
slower.

The PLSI configuration used to generate DefaultConfig is shown in
Figure~\ref{res:rocket-config} and is pretty boring: there's a little bit of
derating for PAR, but that's just about as good as I'm able to do for anything.
The post-PAR results show that it's close to meeting timing, and that there
aren't too many DRC errors so the results are probably believable.

The Hwacha results are, however, a whole different story.  As you can see from
the PLSI configuration file, the physical design here gets very bad QoR --
there's a 50\% clock rate difference between the post-PAR and post-synthesis
results.  While some of this can be attributed to Rocket Chip's memories not
mapping well to the 32nm EDK's SRAMs (which have to write masks), a significant
part of this is probably due to the poor floorplan quality.  From looking at
Figure~\ref{res:hwacha-icc}, you can see how the floorplan generated from
Figure~\ref{res:hwacha-fppy} is quite bad: you can see how the L2 is too wide
and too short, which results in there being no space for the actual core logic.
